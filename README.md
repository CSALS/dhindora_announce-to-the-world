# Substack for India

## Inspiration
From mythological times, Dhindoras are part of Indian realms. Dhindoras are the basic communication channels for the kings to convey information to their people. They go from street to street and convey the message by singing and drumming. Similarly, we are replicated Dhindoras digitally using our app to communicate information through whatsapp.

In India, Whatsapp has 500M users. It is a primary source of communication. Leveraging that we built this user-friendly application.

Large businesses have access to technology to reach a wider audience. Through our app Dhindora we are enabling mom and pop businesses.  

## What it does
Creators like Bloggers, Self-employers, Influencers can use dhindora to spread their ideas.  The Creator can send his articles to his audience via WhatsApp. So our app dhindora takes care of carrying the message from the creator to his subscribers securely without revealing their phone numbers.
By using Dhindora:
* ShopKeepers can share their latest collections/offers.
* Bloggers can share their thoughts.
* Influencers can share their lives.
* Can be used to share news and alerts inside societies.
India is a diverse country with a total of 20 major languages, so we provide multilingual support to our users. We translate the creator's message to the user's preferred regional language.
